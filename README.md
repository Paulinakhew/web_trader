# web_trader
Web Trader is a trading website that consolidates data from Nasdaq, allowing the user to search up the ticker symbol and price of any stock. I employed HTML and CSS to format all the pages and used Python for the back end development. All of the user information, transactions, holdings, and balances are stored in a SQLite3 database. Not only can users search up stocks, they can buy and sell using their own funds. The goal is to end up with a large profit. To the right is a screenshot of the user's dashboard, which displays current holdings as well as previous transactions.
This app runs using Flask. After downloading all files, type "python3 web_controller.py" into your terminal to run the app locally. Next, paste "http://127.0.0.1:5000/login" into your web browser and have fun!
