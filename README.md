# Web Trader
Web Trader is a trading website that consolidates data from Nasdaq, allowing the user to search up the ticker symbol and price of any stock. I employed HTML and CSS to format all the pages and used Python for the back end development. All of the user information, transactions, holdings, and balances are stored in a SQLite3 database. Not only can users search up stocks, they can buy and sell using their own funds. The goal is to end up with a large profit.
